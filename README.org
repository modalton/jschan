ToDo Backend:
Banning controller
Banning middleware for threads
Delete routes && mod dashboard
User input validation needs a rework
Make sure thread_post_id exists in comments::createcomment sql
Similar sql error to above in reports::createReport sql
Restrict file type upload
Redirect unknowns to frontend
Tests
Don't respond w/sql response to client
Binding to sigint in dbconfig seems to stall exiting so have to call it manually. Might have been a windows thing. check


ToDo frontend:
Report interface
need to fix and update to most recent webpack version
Add prop types
Protected routes
Find someone intrested in front end to flush this out & do tests?
